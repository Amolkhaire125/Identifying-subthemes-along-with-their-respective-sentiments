# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis using BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model for natural language processing tasks. The model is fine-tuned on a sentiment analysis dataset to classify text into different sentiment categories.

## Overview:

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It is a valuable tool for understanding customer feedback, social media sentiment, and user reviews. In this project, we leverage BERT for sentiment analysis due to its robust performance and ability to capture contextual information in text.

## Model Selection:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is chosen as the model for sentiment analysis due to the following reasons:
- State-of-the-art Performance: BERT has demonstrated excellent performance on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.
- Pretrained on Large Corpus: The model is pretrained on a large corpus of text data, allowing it to capture complex patterns and relationships in language effectively.
- Contextual Embeddings: BERT generates contextual embeddings for words, capturing the meaning of words in the context of the entire sentence.

## Fine-tuning Approach:

- **Feature Extraction**: We use BERT as a feature extractor rather than fine-tuning the entire model. Only the classifier head on top of the model is trained, while the pre-trained weights are frozen.
- **Robust Features**: By leveraging BERT's ability to extract rich and robust features from text data, we enhance the performance of sentiment classification.
- **Reduced Training Time**: Fine-tuning only the classifier head reduces training time and memory requirements while still benefiting from the powerful features learned by BERT.

## Usage:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing functions.
2. **Model Training**: Train the BERT-based sentiment analysis model using the training data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using various evaluation metrics.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for sentiment analysis tasks in real-world applications.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
